        ## What is Programming?
        * Some may call it Coding (interchangeable), but some may disagree...
        * In layman terms:
        > Programming allows you to "instruct" a "computer" to perform a task

        ### Instruct
        Computers are good followers. It will do everything you provide as instructions...

        ...even the wrong ones...

        ### Computer

        A computer is not just your PC or notebook. 

        Even your smartphone, your smart TV and your fitbit are some kind of computers.

        ### Actually....

        Programming is like "talking" to a computer - you want the computer to understand your words or instructions.

        ### Actually....

        Programming is like "talking" to a computer - you want the computer to understand your words or instructions.
        
        and that's why we use a "programming langauge" to instruct the computers...

        ## Why do I want to instruct a computer a.k.a programming?

        ---

        ## If we want the computer to complete a task, how should we instruct it with programming?

        * Think and plan what you want to achieve with the code
        * Break it down to smaller steps
        * Tackle the steps one at a time (write snippets of code and test!)

        ### In today's workshop

        We will learn how to instruct a mini-computer using simple instructions you and I can pick up quickly
        ---
        ## Introducing - Arduino

        ## Arduino

        * Arduino is made up of both hardware and software. 
        * The Arduino board is a printed circuit board (PCB) designed to use a microcontroller chip as well as other input and outputs. 
        ---
        ## Microcontroller

        * You can think it as the brain of your device
        * it is responsible to execute the instructions you have written to complete a task
        * Examples will be shown later in the tutorials
        
        ---
        ### Programming on an Arduino device

        You will need to 
        * learn some common language understood by the Arduino platform
        * learn to write down the instructions in the right sequence
        * test the written code to see whether the code works 

        ---

        ### Getting prepared to program on an Arduino device

        * Get familiar with the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
        * Understand the features of the Arduino board
        * Be ready to make mistakes and start all over again
        * Stay curious and explore!
